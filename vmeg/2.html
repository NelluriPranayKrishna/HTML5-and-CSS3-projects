    <p>The prime objective of Vardhaman College is to update and modernize the quality of professional education. Its aim is to employ innovative teaching methods which carry an emphasis on fast changing technological trends. This is to integrate classroom learning with actual work experience in the industry concerned or in a related professional field. The college aims to encourage students from the first year B.Tech itself, to identify suitable work areas and to execute projects of their own choice and interest. The teaching-learning process is carried-out through the use of overhead and LCD projectors. Vardhaman boosts facilities such as an extensive computer centre, library, advanced lab for communication skills, internet centre and spacious seminar halls and Electronic classrooms.</p>
    <h3>Our Vision</h3>
    <p> To aim at inculcating the spirit of high ambitions, healthy attitudes, discipline and multidimensional excellence in the students and strive to mould them to scale new heights and get their mental horizons enlarged through valuebased technical education and congenial study environment.</p>
    <h3>Our Mission</h3>
    <p>To sharpen the inherent professional skills of our students to enable them compete in the complex world through our newly evolved quality management system and dedicated staff. The practical oriented education and the research tieup with industries we provide, tend to promote the intellectual pursuits of the students.</p>
    <p>Established in 1999, Vardhaman College of Engineering is affiliated to Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University (JNTU), Hyderabad, and is approved by the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), New Delhi.</p>
